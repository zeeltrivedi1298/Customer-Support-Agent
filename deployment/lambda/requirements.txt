# Lambda-specific requirements
# These packages will be included in the Lambda deployment package

# Mangum - ASGI adapter for AWS Lambda
mangum==0.17.0

# Include all backend requirements
-r ../../backend/requirements.txt

# Note: Some packages may need to be included as Lambda Layers
# due to the 50MB deployment package size limit:
# - chromadb (large package, consider using S3 for vector store)
# - langchain packages (can be bundled as a layer)
# - openai

# Recommended Lambda Layer structure:
# Layer 1: Core dependencies (langchain, openai, pydantic)
# Layer 2: Vector store (chromadb or use S3-backed alternative)
# Deployment package: Application code + mangum
